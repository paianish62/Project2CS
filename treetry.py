"""
This file assess and categorizes countries for investment opportunities ,based on their economic performance and
ethical standings. It features the implementation of a Tree data structure to organize countries according to various
criteria, including GDP growth, CPI inflation, interest rates, sector participation, and Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Functions within this file handle the normalization of economic data, calculation of ethical
scores, classification of countries into investment terms, and mapping of countries to their respective economic
sectors. The goal is to provide a structured and queryabl representation of countries for informed investment
decision-making.
